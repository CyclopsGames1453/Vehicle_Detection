# Vehicle_Detection
It is an application developed using Python and OpenCV2. It allows you to detect vehicles in a video.

# Here's how the application works:

-The program uses the OpenCV library to identify and process the video.

-Image processing techniques are applied to detect vehicles in video frames.

-When a vehicle is detected, the program can draw bounding boxes around the vehicles.
